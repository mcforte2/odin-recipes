    <li>Add sour cream, milk, butter, salt, pepper, 1/2 cup cheese, and 1/2 of the green onions to the potato; mix with
      a hand mixer until well blended and creamy.</li>
    <li>Spoon the mixture into the potato skins; top each with remaining cheese, green onions, and bacon.</li>
    <li>Return potatoes to the preheated oven and continue baking until the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes. Serve
      Hot!</li>
